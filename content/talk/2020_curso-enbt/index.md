The second edition of this grad course happened in-person (!!) at the Escola Nacional de Botânica Tropical at the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden between Feb 10th and Feb 14th 2020 

This is a 40h grad school level course I planned during my PNPD Post-doctoral fellowship at the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden. I co-taught the second edition with Sara Mortara (IIS). The course program includes an introduction to Open and Reproducible Science, best practices of project structure and data management in R, version control with git, writing reproducible manuscripts with LaTeX, rmarkdown, and Zotero. We offered this course twice, in [2019](/2019_curso_enbt) and 2020.
