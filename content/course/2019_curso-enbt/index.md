The first edition of our grad course happened at the Escola Nacional de Botânica Tropical at the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden between July 15th and July 19th 2019

This is a 40h grad school level course I planned during my PNPD Post-doctoral fellowship at the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden. I invited Sara R. Mortara and Diogo S.B. Rocha, two fellow post-doctoral researchers, to co-teach it. The course program includes an introduction to Open and Reproducible Science, best practices of project structure and data management in R, version control with git, writing reproducible manuscripts with LaTeX, rmarkdown, and Zotero. We offered this course twice, in 2019 and [2020](/course/2020_curso_enbt)
