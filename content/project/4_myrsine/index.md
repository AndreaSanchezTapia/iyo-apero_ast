We analyzed the relationship between the occupation of the environmental space (the ecological niche breadth), the geographic space (the potential distribution), and the ecosystems occupied by thirteen species of the genus _Myrsine_ in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. 

This work was a collaboration with the Botany Laboratory at Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo (UFES).
