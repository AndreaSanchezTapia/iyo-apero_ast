I was part of the [Observatório COVID-19 BR](https://covid19br.github.io) between May 2021 and July 2021. This was a scientific citizenship, volunteer-based group that aimed to bring awareness about the public health measures around COVID-19 in Brazil.

I was part of the Observatorio's Data team. Some of my tasks were: 

+ Computational workflow organization, writing functions and scripts, ensuring reproducibility
+ Nowcasting of the COVID-19 cases in Brazil using Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing (McGough _et al_ 2020) to correct for delays in notification
+ Map building and visualizations about the state of the pandemic
+ I presented a [Keynote Talk](/talk/conectar) about our work at [ConectaR 2021](https://conectar2021.github.io/ConectaR2021/).
+ Meetings with the Health Officers of some towns in Brazil (Campinas, Diadema in São Paulo) to find ways to communicate the results of our analyses and help alert and tackle the spread of the pandemic. Participation in one of their weekly bulletins.
+ Participation in one radio interview and liaison with data journalists, collaborative writing of twitter threads, open letters, scientific manuscripts:
