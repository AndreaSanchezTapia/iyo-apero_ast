We studied a series of pastures attained by repeated fires in the Poço das Antas Biological Reserve, from the constatation that the phylogenetic structure was deeply modified (Viany et al 2018) and that the resulting vegetation is undergoing a transition towards derived savanna (Sansevero et al 2019). A synthesis about the dual nature of the transition, which breaks the fire cycle but leads the vegetation to empoverished succession states, was published in Sánchez-Tapia et al (2020).
