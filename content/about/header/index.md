I am a Colombian biologist (she/her). I work as a PNPD/CAPES post-doctoral fellow at the Scientific Computation Lab at the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden. My main interests are Biodiversity Informatics and Community Ecology.

Since I am Colombian but work in Brazil and currently live in the USA, different categories will indicate if the content is in [English](/categories/english/), [Español](/categories/español/) or [Português](/categories/português/) (most of it).
