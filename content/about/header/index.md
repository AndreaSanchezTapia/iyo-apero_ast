I have a deep interest in Open and Responsible Science. I have been using and teaching R since 2009 and 2013, respectively. I am a [CODATA-RDA](https://www.ictp-saifr.org/2018-codata-rda-school-of-research-data-science/) _alumna_ and a Certified Carpentries Instructor. I co-organized RLadies Rio de Janeiro. I recently started collaborating in translation workflows for [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/afterword/contributors-record.html#andrea-sanchez-tapia).

I post content in [English](/categories/english/), [Spanish](/categories/español/), and [Portuguese](/categories/português/). Whenever possible, I post materials in more than one language.
